I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

I have completed a coding project that covers the topic of member functions, constructors, destructors, and privacy in C++. 
These are some of the important concepts in object-oriented programming, which allow us to create and manipulate complex data types.

Member functions are the functions that belong to a class and can access its data members and other member functions. 
Constructors are special member functions that are invoked when an object of the class is created. 
They are used to initialize the data members of the object. Destructors are also special member functions that are invoked when an object of the class is destroyed. 
They are used to release any resources that the object has allocated. Privacy is the mechanism that controls the access to the data members and member functions of a class. 
There are three levels of privacy: public, protected, and private. 
Public members can be accessed by anyone, protected members can be accessed by the class itself and its derived classes, and private members can only be accessed by the class itself.

I learned a lot from this project, but I also faced some difficulties. Some of the difficulties that I encountered were:

- Choosing the appropriate level of privacy for the data members and member functions of the class. I had to balance between the need for encapsulation and the need for inheritance and polymorphism.
- Writing the constructors and destructors correctly. I had to make sure that they did not cause any memory leaks or dangling pointers, and that they followed the rule of three or the rule of five, depending on the situation.
- Debugging the errors and bugs in the code. I had to use various tools and techniques, such as breakpoints , to find and fix the errors and bugs in the code.
