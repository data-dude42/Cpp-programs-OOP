REFLECTION:


In this workshop-08 i learn about the abstract classes and the use of virtual function very effciently.
 This workshop is really easy as I face less compilation errors than the previous workshops. 
In this workshop the main problem i face while coding the "ChequingAccount" module but then i refers to the notes that are available on intro2oop.sdds.ca. As the "ChequingAccount" 
is a concrete class as it derives its functionality from the Account class but i was able to manage all the things very easily. 
This workshop mainly describes the uses of virtual functions which enhances the code flexibility and extensibility(polymorhic behaviour) and the functions can be used again and again with different purposes. 
Laslty, i also learnt the use of abstract class which serves to provide some common functionality across a set of related classes while also allowing default implementations;
