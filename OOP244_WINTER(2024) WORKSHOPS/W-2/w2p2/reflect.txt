Authenticity Declaration:
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I learned how to use the "new" and "delete" operators in C++ to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically during program execution. 
This is useful for managing data that has variable size or lifetime, such as reading from files. 
I also learned about function overloading, which allows me to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. 
This makes the code more flexible and readable, as I can use the same function name for different data types or situations.

One of the challenges I faced was dealing with memory leaks, which occur when allocated memory is not freed properly. 
This can cause the program to consume more memory than needed, or even crash. 
To fix this, I had to review the basics of memory management, examine my code carefully, and use debugging tools to find and correct the errors. 
It was a time-consuming and frustrating process, but it paid off in the end. I was able to free all the memory that I had allocated, and improve the performance and reliability of my program. 
This experience enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of memory management.
