ANSWER: In this workshop1 of object-orinted programming. i learnt a lot of new concepts and techniques which includes the most important topic called the "bubble sort algorithm" which is used for swapping adjacent elements 
if they are in  wrong order,However,it is not suitable for very large data sets because of the reason that it's average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.But due to
its ease of understanding it is often used to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm due to its simplicity.Further, as compared to IPC144 these workshops comes up with lots of modules , 
in this workshop1 as we are given with a number of modules like (io,graph,file,stmark) these modules together made up the whole workshop in which there is a program which prints the students records sorted in 
descending order based on the marks which has a total of 10 groups. One thing that is noticed is c++ programming is the use of namespaces, namespace in applications written simulatenously by a developers, 
chances are high that some developers will use the same identifier for different variables in the application so ,while assembling code, naming conflicts will arise. 
so namespaces are used in c++ programs by developing each part of an application within its own namespace and scoping variables within each namespace.
in seneca we use the seneca namespace. in this workshops some the thing were a bit confusing and difficult to handle is in the DIY part the construction of stMarks module in which we have to add a bool printReport(const char* filename); 
which tries to open the students mark data file, if it is successfull it will print report based on the data in the file and  returns true if it is opened successfully otherwise false.
