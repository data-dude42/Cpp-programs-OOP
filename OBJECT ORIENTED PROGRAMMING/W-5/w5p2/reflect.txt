I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
*****************************************************************/
The session was simpler than expected due to the clear purpose.
The member operators were very simple to understand and implement since they were similar to overloaded functions.
The auxiliary functions were similarly simple to construct because the workshop explicitly outlined what needed to be done.
After reviewing the dynamic allocation,
 I discovered an error, instead of allocating memory for the data member,
 I created a new local variable and allocated dynamic memory to it.
